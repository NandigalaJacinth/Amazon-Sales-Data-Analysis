# Amazon Sales Data Analysis

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Amazon sales data using Python and Power BI. The primary objective is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can inform business decisions.

## Key Features

1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**:
   - Importing raw sales data from Amazon.
   - Cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to explore the dataset.
   - Identifying key metrics such as total sales, average order value, and customer demographics.
   - Analyzing seasonal trends, sales distribution, and product performance.

3. **Data Visualization with Power BI**:
   - Creating interactive dashboards to visualize sales trends and performance metrics.
   - Using Power BI to provide dynamic insights and facilitate data-driven decision-making.

4. **Insights and Recommendations**:
   - Drawing actionable insights from the analysis to optimize sales strategies.
   - Providing recommendations for inventory management, marketing campaigns, and customer engagement.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: For data cleaning, analysis, and initial visualizations.
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive and insightful dashboards.
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib**: Essential Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization.

## Objectives

- Gain a deep understanding of sales performance and customer behavior.
- Identify key factors influencing sales and profitability.
